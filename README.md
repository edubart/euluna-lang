# Euluna

Euluna is a programming language with the following goals:

* Have a clean syntax similiar to Lua (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
* Statically type checked but without having to always specify the type of variables
* Easy to go lower level by mixing C++/C/Assembly code
* Easy to go higher level by mixing Lua code
* Compile a subset to Lua
* Compile to C++ then to native code using a modern compiler
* Meta programmable
* Work dynamically or statically depending on the backend (Lua or C++)
* Safe to code
* Generate readable, simple and performant C++ and Lua code

## Why?

We love to script in Lua.
We love C/C++ performance.
We want best of both worlds in a single language and with similiar syntax.
We want to reuse existing C/C++/Lua code

## Status

Very new, being developing.
Currently is coded in Lua 5.1, in the future it maybe coded using itself.
